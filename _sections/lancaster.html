<p>I spent December 2017 at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/sorianom/">Dr. Leandro Marcolino's</a> lab at Lancaster University.</p>
<p>I was part of his research group working on the enhancement of UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search. Most of my work revolved around understanding how the algorithm worked and then generating plots to analyse the functioning of the algorithm. </p>
