<p> I spent June 2017 at <a href="https://cerelabs.com/">Cere Labs</a>, Mumbai, India. I worked there as a Summer Intern. This was my first time diving into the land of Neural Networks and getting a hands on on building and training Neural Nets! </p>
<p>My task was to work with one of their clients called <a href="http://www.meetkalakar.com/">MeetKalakar</a>. MeetKalakar is an online portal for artists and recruiters and a platform for the two to interact.</p>

<p>While recommending profiles, MeetKalakar had a <b>See Also</b> which recommended similar profiles to the recruiter. There profiles were based on simple keyword match and returned in a random order. My task was to make the recommendations based on analysing the profiles and finding similar profiles.</p>
<p>I chose Gensim's doc2vec to perform the task which converted documents to vectors. Then, I used t-sne to perform dimensionality reduction. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eNRa7yW_XnmyvpyfyYsVAbpcNF2fUtZ4DkO6TTwqQ9o/edit?usp=sharing">Here's</a> a detailed explanation of the whole process of achieving similar profiles.</p>
