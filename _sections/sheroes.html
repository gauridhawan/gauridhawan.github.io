<p>I joined SHEROES as a software development intern in January 2018. The first 3 months revolved around learning basics of Java, SprintBoot and refreshing previous knowledge of SQL. It was in March,2018 when I kickstarted work and dived deep into SHEROE's repository.</p>
<p>I started by building small features initially, such as rendering BookMarks of a person and so on. My initial weeks revolved around feed engineering, where I added small components to the feed to enhance it's freshness, boost engaged posts and much more. My big break was designing and implementing the user-deactivation feature, a feature to remove a user's activity on the platform.  </p>
