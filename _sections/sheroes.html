<p>I joined SHEROES as a software development intern in January 2018. The first 3 months revolved around learning basics of Java, SprintBoot and refreshing previous knowledge of SQL. It was in March,2018 when I kickstarted work and dived deep into SHEROE's repository.</p>
<p>I started by building small features initially, such as rendering BookMarks of a person and so on. My initial weeks revolved around feed engineering, where I added small components to the feed to enhance it's freshness, boost engaged posts and much more. My big break was designing and implementing the user-deactivation feature, a feature to remove a user's activity on the platform.  </p>
<p>Major features that I worked on:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Milestones/Badges</b>: I designed and implemented an event based system to record various activities of users and award them badges. The system worked on incremental basis. The biggest catch in this project was making it generic so that it would cover all the existing badges easily while having scope for new badges to be added.  </li>
        <li><b>Search</b>: This project revolved on fine tuning of Apache Solr in order to support search on the platform. By the virtue of this project, I learnt about Solr indexing and various functions provided by Solr. I was involved in the end to end development of the feature.</li>
        <li><b>Feed Optimization</b>:I was involved in the migration of data-sources used in the feed which resulted in 50% reduction in the response time of our feed API.</li>

    </ul>
