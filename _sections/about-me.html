<p>Hey! I'm a budding junior developer at <a href="https://sheroes.com/">SHEROES</a>. Currently, I develop REST APIs for the platform. Till now, I have worked with SpringBoot, MYSQL, Solr and a bit of Docker. I graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. My undergrad was in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>If not at work, I'm usually scrolling through Medium or completely squandering my time on Instagram! I'm a big foodie! Swimming is one of my favourite hobbies.</p>
<p>I'm a pampered child of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanju-dhawan-073625a/">Sanju Dhawan</a>, and an even more pampered sibling of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geeta-dhawan-249776a5/">Geeta Dhawan</a>.</p>
