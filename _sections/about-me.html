<p>Hey! I'm a budding junior developer at <a href="https://sheroes.com/">SHEROES</a>. I graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology in 2018. My undergrad was in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
<p>I believe in the fact that we should absolutely love what we do. When I'm not at work, I'm usually reading a blog on medium, or sometimes completely wasting my time on Instagram(Trying to control it as much as I can!). </p>
