          <p> I joined <a href="https://sheroes.com/">SHEROES</a> as a Software Engineering Intern early this year. I
            became an Associate Software Engineer at SHEROES in July,2018.</p>
          <p>During my course, I learnt about Java, Solr, Couchbase and Docker(This one has been my favourite!)</p>
          <p>Recently, I finshed the 'search' project at SHEROES. It enables users to search for posts, articles,
            communtiies at SHEROES! This project revolved around fine tuning Solr to find results. </p>
          <p>So I've finally set up seperate couchbase servers for each non produciton machine. Yay! We have our
            micro-services as different docker containers so getting them to talk was a hinderence. P.S. My CTO is
            really proud of me for doing this! </p>
          <p>I'm learning bash scripting side by side. (grep, scpy, tail, vi, lns till now)</p>
          <p>Just gave a tech talk on Docker! Hit me up for the slides!</p>
          <p>My first <b>Docker</b> task was integrating new-relic with our non-production evnironments. I came up with
            this idea since we didnot monitor the response time on our non production evnironments and that resulted in
            crashes on the production server. This one time, we ran an API in a loop and it was searching over a non
            indexed column. The database was shut down really badly. We had to manually kill the process. So I thought
            its better we analyse the response time on non production environements itself.</p>
          <p>Keeping men out of SHEROES? No worries! I just shipped user-deactivation! You can remove a user's complete
            activity - posts, likes, comments and profile from the platform. </p>
          <p>Well, just released my first feature at SHEROES! Bookmarks! My feature fetches the data a user has
            bookmarked and return a list of them. Yay!</p>
          <p>I also write for SHEROES' tech blog on medium! Check out <a href="https://sheroes.tech/">here</a>for more.</p>

          <p>Landed in Lancaster, United Kingdom</p>
          <p>I'm working with Prof. Leandro Marcolino on an enhanced version of UCT Monte Carlo Tree Search</p>
          <p>I started by understanding how Q-Learning works(Peter Stone videos are of great help if you want to
            start!)</p>
          <p>So, today I understood how MCTS actually works. The recursive part has kind of got me confused.</p>
          <p>I developed a very basic version of MCTS. The paper that we're trying to implement is extremely complex -
            the agents have angles that limit their vision!</p>
          <p>The weather here it's super cold and I just saw snow for the very first time!</p>

          <p>Hey! I spent my summer at Cere Labs, Mumbai.</p>
          <p>I started working on building an intent-recoginition model. Natural Language Processing is quite a bit
            interesting.</p>
          <p>I started about with how Chatbots work - IBM Watson for example. They somewhere perform intent
            recognition. I read about all sorts of LSTMs and Siamese LSTMs. Great stuff!</p>
          <p>I just presented a small kind of talk on back-propagation.</p>
          <p>I moved to another project - building a recommendation system for MeetKalakar, a website that hosts
            profiles of artists.</p>
          <p>In order to cluster the documents, I've decided to use doc2Vec by Gensim and tsne algorithm for
            dimensionality reduction.</p>

        <h4>Image Steganography (LSB Method)</h4>
        <p><li>Text data was converted to its binary format where each alphabete represented in 8 bits.</li><li>The text data is encoded in the image by modifying the least significant bit of each pixel to represent the value of the text data</li><li>The first 8 pixels specified the length of the data following which the data was encoded</li></p> -->
